Model fidelity:
- Recommender system trained using 75%/25% train-test split
- Top-20 recommendations (inc. ones the user has rated before) were listed for all users
- Association rules were calculated with max. antecedent length of 3, consequent length of 1, min. support of 0.005 and min. confidence of 0.3
- Using a 1% sample of all users (sampled using the modulus operator in natural user ordering), model fidelity was calculated to be 0.15422382671480145 (~15.4%) when only considering ratings in the training set. This was done using global association rules only

MF-model
- Model was trained using the MovieLense 20m set of ratings, with a 75%/25% train-test split. Model was eveluated using Root Mean Square Error on the test dataset. Models with different number of factors were tested.
- Model with n_factors = 100: 0.7894
- Model with n_factors = 50: 0.7896
- Model with n_factors = 10: 0.7971
